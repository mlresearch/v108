title: Tighter Theory for Local SGD on Identical and Heterogeneous Data
abstract: 'We provide a new analysis of local SGD, removing unnecessary assumptions
  and elaborating on the difference between two data regimes: identical and heterogeneous.
  In both cases, we improve the existing theory and provide values of the optimal
  stepsize and optimal number of local iterations. Our bounds are based on a new notion
  of variance that is specific to local SGD methods with different data. The tightness
  of our results is guaranteed by recovering known statements when we plug $H=1$,
  where $H$ is the number of local steps. The empirical evidence further validates
  the severe impact of data  heterogeneity on the performance of local SGD.'
