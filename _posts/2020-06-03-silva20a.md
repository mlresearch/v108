title: Optimization Methods for Interpretable Differentiable Decision Trees Applied
  to Reinforcement Learning
abstract: " Decision trees are ubiquitous in machine learning for their ease of use
  and interpretability. Yet, these models are not typically employed in reinforcement
  learning as they cannot be updated online via stochastic gradient descent. We overcome
  this limitation by allowing for a gradient update over the entire tree that improves
  sample complexity affords interpretable policy extraction. First, we include theoretical
  motivation on the need for policy-gradient learning by examining the properties
  of gradient descent over differentiable decision trees. Second, we demonstrate that
  our approach equals or outperforms a neural network on all domains and can learn
  discrete decision trees online with average rewards up to 7x higher than a batch-trained
  decision tree. Third, we conduct a user study to quantify the interpretability of
  a decision tree, rule list, and a neural network with statistically significant
  results (p < 0.001)."
